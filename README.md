# mess_hall_rfid_reader

Eclipse (Java)
DBeaver (PostgreSQL) > postgresql-10.6-1-windows

This program is split into 2 parts
- it registers the employees basic info (ID, Name, RFID) to PostgreSQL DB
- it takes the attendence of those employees at breakfast, lunch and dinner time using their RFID cards


NOTE: I made this program in a hurry, if I see that more people are using it, I'll optimize it more, and of course I'll add more features. although I doubt it'll be used ^,^
